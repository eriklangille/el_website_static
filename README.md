No.JS custom blog

I want to keep my website as simple as possible so that it is easy to maintain. That means no JS libraries. Using AWS S3 + Cloudfront + Route 53 for hosting. This should keep the blog fast and be able to handle large amounts of traffic.

Simple Python script contained in one file to build the website using Jinja from HTML files and markdown for the blog posts.
